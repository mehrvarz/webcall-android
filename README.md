# WebCall for Android

WebCall for Android offers the following features on top of the core WebCall package:

- NFC Connect
- Ring on speaker
- Receiving calls while in deep sleep
- Automatic use of ear piece if available
- Proximity sensor to turn off backlight
- Low battery consumption

WebCall for Android offers all WebRTC 1.0 based audio/video telephony features as provided by the core WebCall client. This includes low latency E2E-encrypted P2P communications and very high audio quality using the Opus codec (two-way 20-280kbp/s).

When you run the WebCall client, anybody on the Web can give you a call. Your callers only need to know your personal WebCall link (your WebCall "phone number").

### NFC Connect

NFC Connect lets you establish phone calls by touching two devices. Once connected the two parties can split and walk away, while continuing the call. The other device does not require any special software. It only needs internet (mobile or wifi), NFC and a 2020+ web browser. If both devices are connected to the same Wifi network, the call will establish directly over Wifi.

### Ring on Speaker

WebCall for Android can play back the ringtone on the loud speaker, even if you have a headset connected. If you intend to use a headset, this feature can simplify picking up calls a lot.

### Receiving calls while in sleep mode

WebCall for Android lets you receive calls while your device is in deep sleep mode. This is something the Web client does not support. It makes the Android client a much better solution for all day operations.

### Low power requirements

WebCall for Android has very moderate power requirements. It can run in the background all day in order to receive calls at any time. Unlike a regular phone application, it does not require a SIM card.
